# TaskMaster
This project features a visually appealing To-Do List application with an engaging landing page. Using HTML for structure, CSS for styling and animations, and JavaScript for dynamic interactions and local storage, the project allows users to manage tasks efficiently. The landing page showcases a background animation and a call-to-action button to encourage users to start using the app. The To-Do List itself lets users add, complete, and remove tasks, with data saved in the browser's local storage to ensure persistence. This combination of skills creates an interactive, user-friendly experience that enhances task management and overall productivity.
